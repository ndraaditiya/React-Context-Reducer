# React-Context-Reducer
This is just a simple Todo App, I get the API from this repo: https://github.com/ndraaditiya/public-api-crud-todoApp

This project is created for you all who want to learning React-Redux and have a little bit trouble to understanding the workflow

In this project, I created pretty similar workflows with React-Redux but not using React-Redux library

I just use two React hooks for this, useContext and useReducer. Hope you guys understand the workfloww.

You can see the project on here: https://react-context-reducer.netlify.app/
